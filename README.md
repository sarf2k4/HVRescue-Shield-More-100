# What is an [HV Rescue Shield](https://mightyohm.com/blog/products/hv-rescue-shield-2-x/)?
It is a shield primarily used to 'rescue/salvage' atmega chips by applying high voltage ~12v and resets the fuse settings of the target chip.

This is also one of the features of the atmega chip to prevent from others on tampering the original firmware. Assuming that the firmware are final.

# Disclaimer
I only compiled all related to the HV Rescue Shield that made by MightyOhm and its sketch under one place.

The sketch included were known to be best in the [public domain](https://mightyohm.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5861); originally by Jeff Keyzer, modified by Dennis Tricker and Peter Boxler (2016)

The sketch found on this repo may look different from the original, it is for easier readability, configuration and etc.
